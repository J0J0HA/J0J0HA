Iâ€™m J0J0HA aka. JoJoJux  
I'm good in Python and JavaScript (and HTML & CSS, but these aren't really a programming languages)  
I'm mostly programming modules, that are making things easier (like jerver, currently not public) or are connecting to web-services via selenium (like wwshc (public) and ploudos-api; (not public because its illegal and i'm not using it anymore))
